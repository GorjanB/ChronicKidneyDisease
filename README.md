# Diagnosis of early Chronic Kidney Disease

The **goal** of this project is to identify the health parametars that help us detect early chronic kidney disease and create a diagnosis tool.

The dataset that we are working with consists of health parameters from patients who have/don't have chronic kidney disease. 

The creator of the dataset is Dr.P.Soundarapandian.M.D., of Alagappa University.
